        <p>HMS Erin was a dreadnought battleship of the Royal Navy, originally ordered under the name Reşadiye by the Ottoman government from the British company Vickers. She was designed to be at least the equal of any ship afloat or under construction. Nearly complete when the First World War was beginning in August 1914, the ship was seized at the orders of Winston Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty, to keep her in British hands and prevent her from being used by Germany or its allies. Aside from a minor role in the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 and the inconclusive Action of 19 August the same year, Erin's service during the war generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea. Deemed obsolete after the war, the ship was reduced to reserve and used as a training ship. Erin served as the flagship of the reserve fleet at the Nore sandbank for most of 1920. She was sold for scrap in 1922. (Full article...)</p>

        <p>The brown quail (Synoicus ypsilophorus) is a species of small, ground-dwelling bird in the pheasant family, Phasianidae. Native to mainland Australia, Tasmania and Papua New Guinea, the species has been introduced to New Zealand and Fiji. It is common in much of its wide range, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of least concern. This brown quail was photographed at Sydney Olympic Park in New South Wales, Australia.</p>
